A2VGA

This project is a new hardware implementation of the work done by Mark Aikens and David Kuder of the VGA analog card for Apple2.

The card is based on RPI Pico, 74LVC245 chips and a PLD. It is all through-hole. An improvement is that an ATF22V10 is used, which has sufficient I/O lines to allow that all necessaty bits of the address bus (A0-A10) are decoded for correct switching off of the ExtROM, in case the RPI firmware is using this memory.

This v1.6 implements:
  * IRQ and USB-power functionalities necessary for the A2USB firmware kindly provided by Thorsten Brehm: https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2USB
  * removed the reset circuitry
  * removed voltage dividers

N.B.: Please note that I have not tested the gerbers yet due to time constraints, so please report any errors.
